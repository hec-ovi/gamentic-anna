"""Prompt assembly. This is workstream G.

The prose lives in editable markdown templates under orchestrator/prompts/ (so it
is easy to review and tune without touching code). This module loads them fresh
each call and fills {{placeholders}}; it computes the dynamic sub-blocks (state,
lore, scene transcript) and owns the tool schemas (those are structured, not prose).

Single model, different message stacks:
  - Narrator: omniscient. Full world state, recent history, matched lore. Directs the scene.
  - Character: local POV. Only its persona, private knowledge, and what happens at its location.

Keep prompts lean. Q4 degrades on long context, so history and lore are budgeted hard.
