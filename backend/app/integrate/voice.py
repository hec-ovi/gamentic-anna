"""Voice identity: engine-owned (docs/shared/inference-providers.md).

The engine composes each character's voice DESIGN from their sheet at creation
(gender-aware, spaced apart within the cast; composer ported from voice-api) and
stores it on the character row. The design then resolves to a voice_id the ACTIVE
audio provider understands (local/fal Maya1 = the design text; openai/elevenlabs =
a deterministic concrete voice seeded by character id). Switching providers
re-resolves every character ONCE; a character never changes voice within a provider.
voice-api's /characters registry is no longer written (deprecated by disuse).
Best-effort throughout: if voice is down/disabled, the game plays text-only."""
