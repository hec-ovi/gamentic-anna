"""Glue between the game and the accessory media services.

Voice assignment is fast (a list lookup), so it runs inline at creation. Image
generation is slow, so it runs as a background task; the frontend's /state polling
picks up the URLs when they land. Generated images are DOWNLOADED into a per-game
folder we own and served under /media/<gid>/..., so they persist with the game and
are deleted when the game is wiped. All best-effort: if media is down/disabled, the
game is unaffected and fully playable text-only.

One module per concern (see INDEX.md in this folder); this __init__ re-exports the
whole surface so every caller keeps the single import: `from . import integrate` then
`integrate.<function>(...)`.
