"""Best-effort facade over the accessory media providers (image, voice).

These functions keep their historical signatures (tests and integrate/jobs.py call
them directly) but now dispatch to the ACTIVE provider from app/providers/, resolved
at call time (env -> default). With the default local stack the
wire behavior is byte-identical to what this module always did.

Every call is wrapped so a missing/slow/erroring service NEVER breaks the game:
on any failure these return empty/None and the game stays fully playable text-only.
Gated by IMAGE_ENABLED / voice_enabled() (VOICE_ENABLED, and quiet in Anna mode).
