"""The gift turn and the character whisper (live 2026-06-11 evening):

1. The give picker sends {item:'<inventory id>', target:'<name>'} with NO entity
   chips, so the raw item id reached the public echo - the owner saw "you give
   408f0801a83d to Sera". Echoes show NAMES, never ids; the compose path now resolves
   a bare id against the DB.
2. A gift's reply is owed to the player alone (owner: "when i give item a private
   whisper comes from that character... that must be forced"): the receiver answers in
   the private thread, GUARANTEED, even when the narrator cued nobody. The public
   receipt stays public (a mechanical fact); other characters' reactions stay public.
3. Characters can initiate whispers (owner: "characters should be able to also
   whisper"): a [whisper]...[/whisper] span in ANY reply becomes a private dialogue
   beat with the whisper tone, even on a public turn.
